    "If you want to re-run specific cycles of a point, simply delete the folder. E.g. delete \"...aligned/Point0006/cycle12\") if you want to re-run cycle 12 of Point0006 Already exisitng folders will simply be skipped so you won't have to specify which cycles you want to run. Specifying specific cycles will work as well, but the reference cycles might not be correct in that case. You could change the first_ref variable and the reference_cycles list, just make sure you know what you're doing. Pay attention to the output of the console to see if the correct reference cycle was picked in case you do that."
